Pure T-SQL stored procedure for scripting out MSSQL objects

## Description

Have you ever wanted a pure T-SQL way to script MSSQL objects?
Have you used SQL DMO and thought it was painfully slow?
Ever wished MS would just ship that with SQL Server?
Yeah... me too.

## Project Goals

The goals for this project are simple:

1. Provide a simple way to generate SQL for all SQL Server objects from one unified stored proc
1. Ensure parity with SQL DMO generated scripts
